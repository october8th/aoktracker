# AOKTracker

### Overview

Share acts of kindness and encourage others to pay-it-forward!  The purpose of this app is to log acts of kindness and visualize how far the impact of each ripples out. We've used MongoDB, React, Google Maps, Facebook Login, and other technologies to create this app. We are following the MVC design pattern; using Node and Mongoose to query and route the data in the app, and React to build the frontend.

### How does the app work?

1. The app uses MongoDB to store the data.

2. The data is routed to the frontend by way of Mongoose and API requests, using Axios.

3. The data is rendered to the user by the React JS library.

4. The app is hosted on Heroku and the data is stored using mLab.
